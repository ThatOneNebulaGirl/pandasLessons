## What This Is

This repository contains practice exercises I designed using the pandas library in Python 🐍 to clean and manipulate a messy dataset. The focus is on filtering, grouping, and creating clear markers to separate and interpret data reliably.

## Why I Built It

I built this to support a tool for quickly and accurately quoting solar system installation costs. The source data was inconsistent and poorly structured, so I used pandas to clean the table, validate inputs, and reduce manual errors. Through this work, I strengthened my ability to reason about structured data, verify assumptions, and debug data-related issues—skills that translate well to analyzing logs and diagnostic outputs in technical systems.

## What I Learned

- How to clean and normalize inconsistent tabular data using pandas
- How to validate inputs and catch edge cases early
- How to write scripts that reduce manual, error-prone processes

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Place the PriceSheet folder in the root
3. Run `python clean_pricing_table.py`
